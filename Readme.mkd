TodoTXT mode for Vim
=====================

Introduction
------------
[Todotxt](http://todotxt.com/) is a command line todo manager originally started by [Gina Trapani](http://ginatrapani.org/). All todos are managed via a simple structured textfile, todo.txt. This mode extends vim to handle todo.txt, done.txt and report.txt files.


Installation
------------
If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend installing [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and then simply copy and paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive.git

If you don't want to use Pathogen check out the mode from Github and move to the .vim directory

    $ git clone https://github.com/sideshowcoder/vimtodotxt ~/Desktop/todotxt
    $ mv ~/Desktop/todotxt/\* ~/.vim/
