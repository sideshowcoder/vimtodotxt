TodoTXT mode for Vim
=====================

Introduction
------------
[Todotxt](http://todotxt.com/) is a command line todo manager originally started by [Gina Trapani](http://ginatrapani.org/). All todos are managed via a simple structured textfile, todo.txt. This mode extends vim to handle todo.txt, done.txt and report.txt files.


Installation
------------
Check out the mode from Github and move to the .vim directory or the directory managed by pathogen to autoload modes

  $ git clone https://github.com/sideshowcoder/vimtodotxt ~/Desktop/todotxt
  $ mv ~/Desktop/todotxt/\* ~/.vim/
